;;show this message for MCA 5.1 and 5.2, but not the Undead 3.0 compatible version of MCA 5.2
[Note]
 Under certain conditions, NPCs spawned by MCA will vanish. This is undesirable when you have used Vampire Embrace to turn them into your children or thrall. You might consider using the "Vampire Embrace MCA Patch" which keeps MCA-spawned NPCs in the game if they have been touched by "Vampire Embrace".

;; @Advanced Guards IV [Marty V. aka "The Puma Man"]

[Note]
	According to its readme "ADVANCED GUARDS IV DOES NOT affect third party mods. So the guards from the Bank mod, for example, will not be affected. If you are concerned about this, you must check the special GUARDS.esp as well. This will make the low-level spawns of guards just as strong as the high level spawns of guards, however."
