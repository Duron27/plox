	"the zone" replaces two of the stock daedric ruin textures:  tx_daed_metal_02.dds  tx_daed_wall_03.dds this will interfere with any daedric texture replacers you are using and cause problems with mge rendering the daedric ruins as distant statics. it is recommended that you delete these two texture files.
