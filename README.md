# PLOX - Plugin Load Order eXpert

> Nexus link: <https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54262>

PLOX is a rust re-write of MLOX, a utility tool to sort a modlist topologically according to ordering rules. PLOX also outputs warnings and notes dependent on the mods in your load order. You can use it as a GUI app or as a commandline tool.

Rules are automatically downloaded from the respective Rules repository (see below for details).

Supported games:

- âœ…TES3 - Morrowind
- âœ…OpenMW
- ðŸš§Cyberpunk 2077

The PLOX GUI supports a configuration file called `plox.toml` (place next to `plox_gui`) that allows you to customize its behavior. Here's an example of how to use the `plox.toml` file:

Required fields:

```toml
no_rules_download = true
log_level = "debug"
log_to_file = true
```

Optional fields:

```toml
config = "openmw.cfg"
game = "OpenMW"
```

## Rules

> Rules spec taken from [mlox - the elder scrolls Mod Load Order eXpert](https://github.com/mlox/mlox).

Plugins are sorted according to rules. For the rules spec see: [Rules Spec](./docs/Rules_spec.md)

The rules are hosted in their own repository:

- TES3 - Morrowind and OpenMW: <https://github.com/DanaePlays/mlox-rules>
- ðŸš§Cyberpunk 2077: <https://github.com/rfuzzo/cmop-rules>

**PRs are welcome!**
