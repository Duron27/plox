# PLOX - Plugin Load Order eXpert

> ðŸš§ Work in progress

A small rust utility to sort a modlist topologically according to ordering rules, as wall as output warnings and notes.

Supported games:

- âœ…TES3 - Morrowind
- âœ…OpenMorrowind
- ðŸš§Cyberpunk 2077

## Rules

> Rules spec taken from [mlox - the elder scrolls Mod Load Order eXpert](https://github.com/mlox/mlox).

Plugins are sorted according to rules. For the rules spec see: [Rules Spec](./docs/Rules_spec.md)

The rules are hosted in their own repository:

- TES3 - Morrowind and OpenMorrowind: <https://github.com/DanaePlays/mlox-rules>
- ðŸš§Cyberpunk 2077: <https://github.com/rfuzzo/cmop-rules>

**PRs are welcome!**
